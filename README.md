content-server
==============

ConServ is a Java-based content server implementation designed for use with [http://www.netdimensions.com/talent-suite/](NetDimensions Talent Suite). It uses Talent Suite's native delegated authentication to protect content, and hence does not depend on an external single sign-on mechanism.
